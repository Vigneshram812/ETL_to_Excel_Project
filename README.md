# ETL to Excel Project

This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python and Pandas. The data is extracted from a CSV file, transformed by adding a new column 'Total' which calculates the product of 'Quantity' and 'Price', and then loaded into an Excel file using the openpyxl engine. 

## Purpose and Usefulness

This project is valuable for analysts to understand essential data manipulation and workflow automation, enhancing efficiency in handling and analyzing data for informed decision-making.

## Specific Use Cases

Specific examples where this program can be used include:

- **Retail Sales Analysis**: Aggregating and transforming daily sales data to monitor product performance and identify trends.
- **Inventory Management**: Calculating total stock value and forecasting inventory needs.
- **Financial Reporting**: Automating the consolidation of financial data from multiple sources for monthly reports.
- **Marketing Analytics**: Analyzing campaign performance by combining and transforming engagement metrics.

## Files

- `etl_script.py`: The main script that performs the ETL process.
- `data/store_sales.csv`: Sample data file.
- `output/transformed_sales.xlsx`: The transformed data file (generated by the script).

## Requirements
