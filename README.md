# ETL Project

This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python and pandas. The data is extracted from a CSV file, transformed by adding a new column, and then loaded into an Excel file.

## Files

- `etl_script.py`: The main script that performs the ETL process.
- `data/store_sales.csv`: Sample data file.
- `output/transformed_sales.xlsx`: The transformed data file (generated by the script).

## Requirements

- Python/ VS code with python extension
- pandas

## How to Run

1. Install the required Python package:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

2. Run the ETL script:
    ```bash
    python etl_script.py
    ```
